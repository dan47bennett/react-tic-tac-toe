# react-tic-tac-toe
A tic-tac-toe game built in React.js and hosted at https://tic-tac-toe-dfc67.web.app/


Inspired by this [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-for-the-tutorial) and this [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKcoQT_Qyo). Built from the React example, this implementation uses functional components in place of a class-based architecture.
